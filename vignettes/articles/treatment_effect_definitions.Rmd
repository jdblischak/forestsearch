# Introduction

ForestSearch implements multiple approaches for quantifying treatment effects
in survival analysis, each grounded in the potential outcomes framework
(Rubin, 1974). When identifying subgroups that experience differential
treatment effects, the choice of estimand matters: different definitions
capture different aspects of treatment effect heterogeneity and carry
distinct assumptions about the underlying data-generating process.
Understanding these distinctions is critical for proper interpretation of
ForestSearch results and for designing simulation studies that
faithfully evaluate operating characteristics.

This vignette defines the three treatment effect measures used throughout
the ForestSearch package, details their computation from an Accelerated
Failure Time (AFT) model with Weibull errors, clarifies the distinction
between DGM-level (super-population) and simulation-level (per-replicate)
hazard ratios, and discusses when each measure is most informative. A
summary comparison table is provided at the end for quick reference.


# Notation and Setup

## Potential Outcomes Framework

For subject $i$ in a two-arm randomized trial with treatment $A_i \in \{0, 1\}$,
the potential outcomes framework posits a pair of survival times:

- $T_i(1)$: survival time had subject $i$ received treatment ($A = 1$),
- $T_i(0)$: survival time had subject $i$ received control ($A = 0$).

Only one potential outcome is observed for each subject. Let
$\mathbf{X}_i$ denote baseline covariates.

## AFT Model Specification

ForestSearch's data-generating mechanisms are built on a Weibull AFT model:

$$
\log T_i(a) = \mu + \mathbf{X}_i(a)^{\top} \boldsymbol{\gamma}
+ \sigma \, \varepsilon_i,
\qquad \varepsilon_i \sim \text{Extreme Value}
$$

where $\mu$ is the intercept, $\sigma > 0$ is the scale parameter, and
$\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ are regression coefficients on the log-time scale.
For the alternative-hypothesis model with heterogeneous treatment effects,
the covariate vector $\mathbf{X}_i(a)$ includes both the treatment
indicator and a treatment-by-subgroup interaction:

$$
\mathbf{X}_i(a)^{\top} \boldsymbol{\gamma}
= a \cdot \gamma_{\text{treat}} + \mathbf{Z}_i^{\top} \boldsymbol{\gamma}_Z
+ a \cdot H_i \cdot \gamma_{\text{int}}
$$

where $H_i \in \{0, 1\}$ flags membership in the harm subgroup and
$\boldsymbol{\gamma}_Z$ are prognostic covariate effects.

## Hazard-Scale Coefficients

The AFT-to-hazard-scale transformation yields:

$$
\boldsymbol{\beta}_0 = -\boldsymbol{\gamma} / \sigma
$$

Under this parameterisation the conditional hazard function is

$$
h(t \mid \mathbf{X}_i) = h_0(t) \exp\left(\mathbf{X}_i^{\top}
\boldsymbol{\beta}_0\right)
$$

and the individual log-hazard contributions under each treatment arm are:

$$
\theta_i(a) = \mathbf{X}_i(a)^{\top} \boldsymbol{\beta}_0
$$

These are stored in the ForestSearch super-population data frame as
`theta_1` (treatment) and `theta_0` (control).


# Treatment Effect Definitions

## Marginal (Causal) Hazard Ratio {#marginal-hr}

### Definition

The **marginal hazard ratio** for a subgroup $\mathcal{S}$ is the
population-level treatment effect obtained by fitting a Cox proportional
hazards model to stacked potential outcomes within $\mathcal{S}$:

$$
\text{HR}_{\text{marg}}(\mathcal{S})
= \exp\left(\hat{\beta}_{\text{Cox}}  \mid 
\text{data} = \left\{\left(T_i(1), 1, 1\right), \left(T_i(0), 1, 0\right)
: i \in \mathcal{S}\right\}\right)
$$

This is the coefficient from a Cox model fit to a dataset where each subject
contributes two rows---one under treatment, one under control---both with
event indicator 1 (since potential outcomes are fully observed in the
super-population).

### Computation in ForestSearch

In `calculate_hazard_ratios()` and `create_gbsg_dgm()`, the marginal HR
is computed as follows:

1. Generate a common set of error terms:
   $\varepsilon_i = \log(\text{Exp}(1))$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n$.

2. Compute potential survival times:
    - $\log T_i(1) = \mu + \sigma \varepsilon_i + \mathbf{X}_i(1)^{\top} \boldsymbol{\gamma}$
    - $\log T_i(0) = \mu + \sigma \varepsilon_i + \mathbf{X}_i(0)^{\top} \boldsymbol{\gamma}$

3. Stack into a single dataset of $2n$ rows with columns
   `time`, `event = 1`, `treat`, `flag_harm`.

4. Fit Cox model: `coxph(Surv(time, event) ~ treat, data = df_stacked)`.

5. Extract: $\text{HR}_{\text{marg}} = \exp(\hat{\beta}_{\text{treat}})$.

### Key Properties

The marginal HR uses the same $\varepsilon_i$ for both potential outcomes,
encoding the causal constraint that each subject's latent frailty is
identical regardless of treatment assignment. This yields a proper
causal estimand under the Rubin framework. However, the Cox model fit
to stacked data targets a population-averaged effect and may deviate
from the conditional (individual-level) hazard ratio when the
proportional hazards assumption does not hold exactly.

### Package Variables

| Variable | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| `hr_causal` / `hr_overall` | Overall marginal HR |
| `hr_H_true` | Marginal HR in harm subgroup $\mathcal{H}$ |
| `hr_Hc_true` | Marginal HR in complement $\mathcal{H}^c$ |


## Average Hazard Ratio (AHR) {#ahr}

### Definition

The **average hazard ratio** (AHR) for a subgroup $\mathcal{S}$ is
defined directly from the individual-level potential-outcome log hazard
ratios:

$$
\text{AHR}(\mathcal{S})
= \exp\left(\frac{1}{|\mathcal{S}|} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}}
\left[\theta_i(1) - \theta_i(0)\right]\right)
= \exp\left(\frac{1}{|\mathcal{S}|} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}}
\log \text{HR}_{i}^{(\text{po})}\right)
$$

where $\log \text{HR}_{i}^{(\text{po})} = \theta_i(1) - \theta_i(0)$ is
the individual causal log hazard ratio.

### Computation in ForestSearch

The AHR is computed from the `loghr_po` column in the super-population
data frame:

1. For each subject, compute potential-outcome log-hazards:
    - $\theta_i(0) = \mathbf{X}_i(0)^{\top} \boldsymbol{\beta}_0$
    - $\theta_i(1) = \mathbf{X}_i(1)^{\top} \boldsymbol{\beta}_0$
    - $\text{loghr\_po}_i = \theta_i(1) - \theta_i(0)$

2. Aggregate over the subgroup:
   $\text{AHR}(\mathcal{S}) = \exp\left(\overline{\text{loghr\_po}}_{\mathcal{S}}\right)$

### Key Properties

The AHR is a deterministic function of the model coefficients and
covariate distribution---it does not depend on the random error
$\varepsilon_i$. This makes it fully reproducible across simulation
replications (given the same super-population). Because it operates
on the log-hazard scale and averages individual effects, it
captures heterogeneity in treatment effect across the covariate
distribution. For a subgroup defined by a biomarker threshold
$z \geq c$, the AHR curve $\text{AHR}(c)$ provides a smooth
summary of how the treatment effect changes with the threshold.

### Package Variables

| Variable | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| `loghr_po` | Individual log HR: $\theta_i(1) - \theta_i(0)$ |
| `AHR` | Overall average hazard ratio |
| `AHR_H_true` / `AHR_harm` | AHR in harm subgroup |
| `AHR_Hc_true` / `AHR_no_harm` | AHR in complement |


## Controlled Direct Effect (CDE) {#cde}

### Definition

The **controlled direct effect** (CDE) hazard ratio for a subgroup
$\mathcal{S}$ is defined as the ratio of average exponentiated
log-hazards under treatment versus control:

$$
\text{CDE}(\mathcal{S})
= \frac{\frac{1}{|\mathcal{S}|}
\sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} \exp\left(\theta_i(1)\right)}
{\frac{1}{|\mathcal{S}|}
\sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} \exp\left(\theta_i(0)\right)}
= \frac{\overline{\exp(\theta_i(1))}_{\mathcal{S}}}
{\overline{\exp(\theta_i(0))}_{\mathcal{S}}}
$$

This is the ratio of average hazard *contributions* (on the natural
scale) under treatment versus control. The term "controlled direct
effect" reflects that each $\theta_i(a)$ controls for baseline
covariates through the linear predictor.

### Computation in ForestSearch

In `cox_ahr_cde_analysis()` and `plot_subgroup_effects()`, the CDE
is computed from the `theta_1` and `theta_0` columns:

1. For each subject, retrieve:
    - $\theta_i(0) = \mathbf{X}_i(0)^{\top} \boldsymbol{\beta}_0$
    - $\theta_i(1) = \mathbf{X}_i(1)^{\top} \boldsymbol{\beta}_0$

2. Compute subgroup CDE:
   $\text{CDE}(\mathcal{S}) = \overline{\exp(\theta(1))}_{\mathcal{S}} / \overline{\exp(\theta(0))}_{\mathcal{S}}$

### Key Properties

Like the AHR, the CDE is deterministic given the super-population
(no dependence on $\varepsilon_i$). However, by averaging on the
hazard (exponential) scale rather than the log-hazard scale, the CDE
gives more weight to subjects with larger absolute hazard contributions.
Jensen's inequality implies that in general
$\text{CDE}(\mathcal{S}) \neq \text{AHR}(\mathcal{S})$, with the
discrepancy increasing as within-subgroup heterogeneity grows.

### Package Variables

| Variable | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| `theta_0` | Log-hazard contribution under control |
| `theta_1` | Log-hazard contribution under treatment |
| `cde_results[["overall"]]` | Overall CDE |
| `cde_results[["recommend"]]` | CDE in recommended subgroup |
| `cde_results[["questionable"]]` | CDE in questionable subgroup |


# Theoretical Relationships

## When All Three Agree

Under a constant treatment effect model (no heterogeneity), the
individual log hazard ratio is identical for all subjects:

$$
\log \text{HR}_i^{(\text{po})} = \beta_{\text{treat}} \quad
\forall\, i
$$

In this case, all three measures coincide:
$\text{HR}_{\text{marg}} = \text{AHR} = \text{CDE} = \exp(\beta_{\text{treat}})$.

## Sources of Divergence

When treatment effects are heterogeneous, three sources of divergence
arise.

First, **Jensen's inequality** separates AHR from CDE:

$$
\exp\left(\overline{\log \text{HR}_i}\right) \neq
\overline{\exp(\theta_i(1))} / \overline{\exp(\theta_i(0))}
$$

unless all $\log \text{HR}_i$ are identical.

Second, the marginal HR from the stacked Cox model can differ from the AHR
because the Cox partial likelihood implicitly weights subjects by their
risk-set contributions, creating a form of **informative censoring** in
the stacked framework.

Third, the marginal HR depends on the realized $\varepsilon_i$ draw,
introducing **Monte Carlo variability** absent from the AHR and CDE.

## Practical Implications for ForestSearch

In the ForestSearch simulation framework, the AHR is the primary
target estimand for characterising treatment effect heterogeneity
because it is deterministic and directly interpretable as the
geometric mean hazard ratio across subjects. The marginal HR serves
as a validation target, confirming that the AFT model's causal
structure produces sensible population-level effects. The CDE
provides a complementary perspective that is particularly useful
when comparing treatment effects across subgroups defined by
continuous biomarker thresholds.


# Computation Under the ForestSearch AFT Model

## Step-by-Step Derivation

Given a fitted AFT model with parameters $(\mu, \sigma, \boldsymbol{\gamma})$:

**Step 1: Hazard-scale transformation**

$$
\boldsymbol{\beta}_0 = -\boldsymbol{\gamma} / \sigma
$$

**Step 2: Build potential-outcome design matrices**

For each subject $i$, construct $\mathbf{X}_i(1)$ (treatment arm)
and $\mathbf{X}_i(0)$ (control arm). The treatment indicator is
set to 1 or 0 respectively; all other covariates remain at their
observed values. Interaction terms (e.g., $A \times H$) are computed
accordingly.

**Step 3: Individual log-hazard contributions**

$$
\theta_i(a) = \mathbf{X}_i(a)^{\top} \boldsymbol{\beta}_0,
\quad a \in \{0, 1\}
$$

$$
\log \text{HR}_i^{(\text{po})} = \theta_i(1) - \theta_i(0)
$$

**Step 4: Treatment effect summaries** for subgroup $\mathcal{S}$

$$
\text{AHR}(\mathcal{S})
= \exp\left(\frac{1}{|\mathcal{S}|} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}}
\log \text{HR}_i^{(\text{po})}\right)
$$

$$
\text{CDE}(\mathcal{S})
= \frac{\sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} \exp(\theta_i(1))}
{\sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} \exp(\theta_i(0))}
$$

$$
\text{HR}_{\text{marg}}(\mathcal{S}):
\text{Cox model on stacked potential outcomes}
$$


## GBSG Example: Harm Subgroup

For the GBSG-based DGM with alternative hypothesis, the harm
subgroup is $\mathcal{H} = \{z_1 = 1 \;\text{AND}\; z_3 = 1\}$
(low estrogen receptor AND premenopausal). The theoretical hazard
ratios from the AFT coefficients are:

$$
\text{HR}(\mathcal{H}) = \exp\left(\beta_0[\text{treat}] +
\beta_0[\text{zh}]\right)
$$

$$
\text{HR}(\mathcal{H}^c) = \exp\left(\beta_0[\text{treat}]\right)
$$

The `k_inter` parameter modulates the interaction coefficient:
$\gamma[\text{zh}] \leftarrow k_{\text{inter}} \times \gamma[\text{zh}]$,
providing direct control over the magnitude of treatment effect
heterogeneity.


# DGM-Level vs. Simulation-Level Hazard Ratios {#dgm-vs-sim}

The variable names `hr.H.true` and `hr.Hc.true` appear in two
distinct contexts within the ForestSearch codebase. Both use the same
computational core---a Cox model fit within the true subgroup defined
by `flag.harm`---but they operate on different data and serve different
purposes. Understanding this distinction is essential for correctly
interpreting simulation operating characteristics.

## DGM-Level Truth (Super-Population)

When `create_gbsg_dgm()` or `calculate_hazard_ratios()` constructs
the data-generating mechanism, the marginal HR is computed from the
**stacked potential outcomes** in a large super-population (typically
$n_{\text{super}} = 5{,}000$). Every subject contributes uncensored
survival times under *both* treatment and control, using the same
random error $\varepsilon_i$ for both arms:
 
```r
# In create_gbsg_dgm() — stacked potential outcomes
df_po <- data.frame(
  time      = c(T_1, T_0),
  event     = 1L,
  treat     = c(rep(1, n_super), rep(0, n_super)),
  flag.harm = rep(flag.harm, 2)
)

hr_H_true <- exp(coxph(
  Surv(time, event) ~ treat,
  data = subset(df_po, flag.harm == 1)
)$coefficients)

hr_Hc_true <- exp(coxph(
  Surv(time, event) ~ treat,
  data = subset(df_po, flag.harm == 0)
)$coefficients)
```

These DGM-level values are essentially **fixed constants** for a given
DGM specification. They define the ground truth against which
estimator performance is evaluated and converge to the theoretical
values:

$$
\text{HR}_{\text{DGM}}(\mathcal{H})
= \exp\!\bigl(\beta_0[\text{treat}] + \beta_0[\text{zh}]\bigr),
\qquad
\text{HR}_{\text{DGM}}(\mathcal{H}^c)
= \exp\!\bigl(\beta_0[\text{treat}]\bigr)
$$

as $n_{\text{super}} \to \infty$.

**Stored as:** `dgm$hr_H_true`, `dgm$hr_Hc_true`, `dgm$hr_causal`;
equivalently in `dgm$hazard_ratios$harm_subgroup`,
`dgm$hazard_ratios$no_harm_subgroup`, `dgm$hazard_ratios$overall`.


## Simulation-Level Truth (Per-Replicate)

During each simulation replicate, `run_fs_analysis()` and
`run_grf_analysis()` in `oc_analyses_gbsg_refactored.R` recompute
the true subgroup HRs on the **simulated sample**---with censoring,
finite sample size, and randomized (not stacked) treatment:

```r
# In run_fs_analysis() — observed data, single treatment arm per subject
hr.H.true <- exp(coxph(
  Surv(y.sim, event.sim) ~ treat,
  data = subset(df, flag.harm == 1)
)$coefficients)

hr.Hc.true <- exp(coxph(
  Surv(y.sim, event.sim) ~ treat,
  data = subset(df, flag.harm == 0)
)$coefficients)
```

These per-replicate values are **random variables** that fluctuate
across simulation iterations due to sampling variability, censoring
patterns, and the particular treatment randomization.

**Stored as:** columns `hr.H.true` and `hr.Hc.true` in the
simulation results `data.table`, one row per replicate.

## Role in Operating Characteristics

In the simulation results produced by `run_oc_gbsg_sims()` and
summarised by `build_estimation_table()`, four HR columns work
together to quantify estimation performance:

| Column | Meaning |
|:-------|:--------|
| `hr.H.true` | Per-replicate Cox HR in the **true** H, using observed data |
| `hr.H.hat` | Cox HR in the **identified** $\hat{H}$, using observed data |
| `hr.H.bc` | Bootstrap bias-corrected HR in $\hat{H}$ |
| `hr.Hc.true` | Per-replicate Cox HR in the **true** $H^c$, using observed data |
| `hr.Hc.hat` | Cox HR in the **identified** $\hat{H}^c$, using observed data |
| `hr.Hc.bc` | Bootstrap bias-corrected HR in $\hat{H}^c$ |

Relative bias is computed against the DGM-level constant
$\theta_H^* = \mathtt{dgm\$hr\_H\_true}$:

$$
\text{Rel. Bias}(\%) = 100 \times
\frac{\overline{\mathtt{hr.H.hat}} - \theta_H^*}{\theta_H^*}
$$

This decomposition allows the simulation to separate two sources of
error: (1) **subgroup misidentification** (the identified $\hat{H}$
may not match the true $H$), and (2) **estimation variability**
(even if $\hat{H} = H$, the Cox coefficient estimate fluctuates in
finite samples).

The per-replicate `hr.H.true` helps diagnose the second source. When
`mean(hr.H.true)` across replicates closely matches `dgm$hr_H_true`,
the simulation is confirming that the DGM produces the intended
treatment effect in finite samples (on average). Any gap between
`mean(hr.H.hat)` and `mean(hr.H.true)` is attributable to subgroup
misidentification, while the gap between `mean(hr.H.true)` and
`dgm$hr_H_true` reflects finite-sample estimation noise.


## Companion AHR Metrics

For each context, a parallel **Average Hazard Ratio** is available:

**DGM-level AHR:** Deterministic, computed from individual
`loghr_po` values in the super-population.

```r
AHR_H_true  <- exp(mean(df_super$loghr_po[df_super$flag.harm == 1]))
AHR_Hc_true <- exp(mean(df_super$loghr_po[df_super$flag.harm == 0]))
```

**Simulation-level AHR:** Can be computed per replicate when
`loghr_po` is carried through to the simulated sample (available via
`simulate_from_gbsg_dgm()`).

The DGM-level AHR and Cox-based marginal HR generally agree closely
but can diverge when within-subgroup treatment effects are highly
heterogeneous, as discussed in Section \@ref(theoretical-relationships).

# Worked Example

The following code demonstrates how the three measures are computed from a
single DGM object, highlighting where they agree and diverge.

```{r worked-example, eval=FALSE}
library(forestsearch)

# Create a GBSG-based DGM with heterogeneous treatment effects

  k_inter = 2.0,

ahr_noharm  <- exp(mean(df$loghr_po[df$flag.harm == 0]))

cat("AHR (overall):", round(ahr_overall, 4), "\n")
cat("AHR (harm):   ", round(ahr_harm, 4), "\n")

cat("\nDGM vs sim-level gap (H):  ",
    round(hr_H_sim - dgm$hr_H_true, 4), "(finite-sample noise)\n")

# --- Biomarker-threshold analysis ---

# Guidance for Choosing an Estimand

The choice among these three measures depends on the analytic objective:

**Use AHR** as the default estimand for ForestSearch simulation studies.
It is deterministic, directly interpretable, and aligns with the
geometric-mean interpretation of treatment effect heterogeneity. The
AHR is the primary target when evaluating operating characteristics
(sensitivity, PPV, bias) across simulation replications.

**Use marginal HR** for validation purposes. The stacked-Cox approach
provides a familiar, model-based estimand that confirms the DGM's
causal structure produces the intended population-level effects. It
is also the natural target for analyses of observed trial data where
potential outcomes are not directly available.

**Use CDE** for complementary analysis when exploring treatment effect
profiles across continuous biomarker thresholds. The CDE's
natural-scale averaging can reveal patterns that are attenuated on
the log scale, particularly when hazard contributions are highly
variable.
