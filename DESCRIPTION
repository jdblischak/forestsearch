Title: Exploratory Subgroup Identification in Clinical Trials with Survival Endpoints
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Larry", "Leon", , "larry.leon.05@post.harvard.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Implements advanced statistical methods for exploratory subgroup 
    identification in clinical trials with survival endpoints. Provides 
    tools for identifying patient subgroups with differential treatment effects 
    using machine learning approaches including Generalized Random Forests ('GRF'), 
    LASSO regularization, and exhaustive combinatorial search algorithms. Features 
    bootstrap bias correction using infinitesimal jackknife methods to address 
    selection bias in post-hoc analyses. Designed for clinical researchers 
    conducting exploratory subgroup analyses in randomized controlled trials, 
    particularly for multi-regional clinical trials ('MRCT') requiring regional 
    consistency evaluation. Supports both accelerated failure time ('AFT') and Cox 
    proportional hazards models with comprehensive diagnostic and visualization 
    tools. Methods are described in León et al. (2024) <doi:10.1002/sim.10163>.
