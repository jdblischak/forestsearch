\usage{
forestsearch_tenfold(
  fs.est,
  sims,
  Kfolds = 10,
  details = TRUE,
  parallel_args = list(plan = "multisession", workers = 6, show_message = TRUE)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fs.est}{List. ForestSearch results object from \code{\link{forestsearch}}.}

\item{sims}{Integer. Number of simulation repetitions.}

\item{Kfolds}{Integer. Number of folds per simulation (default: 10).}

\item{details}{Logical. Print progress details (default: TRUE).}

\item{parallel_args}{List. Parallelization configuration.}
}
\value{
List with components:
\describe{
\item{sens_summary}{Named vector of median sensitivity metrics across simulations}
\item{find_summary}{Named vector of median subgroup-finding metrics}
\item{sens_out}{Matrix of sensitivity metrics (sims x metrics)}
\item{find_out}{Matrix of finding metrics (sims x metrics)}
\item{timing_minutes}{Total execution time}
\item{sims}{Number of simulations run}
\item{Kfolds}{Number of folds per simulation}
}
}
\description{
This function performs multiple independent K-fold cross-validations to
assess the variability in subgroup identification. Each simulation:
\enumerate{
\item Randomly shuffles the data
\item Performs K-fold CV
\item Records sensitivity and agreement metrics
}
Results are summarized across all simulations.
}
\details{
Runs repeated K-fold cross-validation simulations for ForestSearch and
summarizes subgroup identification stability across repetitions.
}
\section{Parallelization Strategy}{

Unlike the single K-fold function which parallelizes across folds, this
function parallelizes across simulations for better efficiency when
running many repetitions. Each simulation runs its K-fold CV sequentially.

\dontrun{
# Run 100 repetitions of 10-fold CV

  fs.est = fs_result,
