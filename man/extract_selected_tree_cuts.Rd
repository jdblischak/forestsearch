\title{Extract cuts from selected tree only}
\usage{
extract_selected_tree_cuts(trees, selected_depth, maxdepth)
}
\arguments{
\item{trees}{List. Policy trees (indexed by depth)}

\item{selected_depth}{Integer. Depth of the selected tree (from best_subgroup$depth)}

\item{maxdepth}{Integer. Maximum tree depth (for populating tree-specific slots)}
}
\value{
List with cuts and names, structured similarly to extract_all_tree_cuts
but with only the selected tree's cuts in the \code{all} field
}
\description{
Extracts cut information only from the tree at the specified selected depth.
This provides a focused set of cuts from the tree that identified the
subgroup meeting the \code{dmin.grf} criterion, rather than cuts from all trees.
}
\details{
This function is used when \code{return_selected_cuts_only = TRUE} in
\code{grf.subg.harm.survival()}. It returns:
\itemize{
\item \code{tree1}, \code{tree2}, \code{tree3}: Individual tree cuts (still populated for reference)
\item \code{names1}, \code{names2}, \code{names3}: Individual tree variable names
\item \code{all}: Cuts from the SELECTED tree only (not union of all trees)
\item \code{all_names}: Variable names from the SELECTED tree only
\item \code{selected_depth}: The depth that was selected
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# When best_subgroup$depth = 2, only tree2 cuts are returned in $all
tree_cuts <- extract_selected_tree_cuts(trees, selected_depth = 2, maxdepth = 2)
tree_cuts$all
# Returns only cuts from depth 2 tree
}
